# Axraquare
A basic platformer game that I made with GDevelop 5. 

A basic parcour game with simple graphics. You will try to finish game without touching red bars. You can use "W" for jump, "A" to move left and "D" to move right.
White bars is platforms that we can move on, red bars are dangerous platforms that you shouldn't touch, yellow spikes are nearly same with red bars' green bars are checkpoint, so you can respawn if you die. And circle is a moving saw that you shouldn't touch as well.

ENJOY!

Not: Extract the exe file inside of the zip file.
